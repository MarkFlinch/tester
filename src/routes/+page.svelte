  p="My art is lively, energetic, and covers an assortment of genres. I use perspective and movement
when creating my work to bring attention to my characters. The overall focus of my art is to
explore the generic use of photography and videography but through animation and digital 2d.
Furthermore, my goal for the future is to expand my knowledge on animation and start
producing short films, then eventually full episodes using dynamic perspective and camera
movement."
